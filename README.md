# Beekeeper Swagger UI

This is a repo containing docker image running Swagger UI. It is mounted in our monolith clusters under `/apidocs` URL. It is mostly used internally for browsing through version API documentation generated in that particular environment - as external developers use our Developer Portal API docs as reference.
